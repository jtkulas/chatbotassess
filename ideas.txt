Idea:

Train LLM with qualitative needs assessment data (e.g., interview transcripts, workshop summaries, questionnaire)

chatbot for needs assessment

Take company pulse along constructs such as engagement, satisfaction, commitment, org identification


chatbot for assessment & contrast with traditional psychological assessment/inventory

LLM tells chatbot what to ask and how to respond

optimal point estimate with chatbot (e.g., how many questions necessary prior to minimizing error in construct estimate?) KULAS PREFERENCE

Use metaphor of IRT - tailor questions toward trait level & stop asking when error minimized on trait estimate (train on different levels of trait)

Method: contrast trait estimates with other measures of trait - correlate all with criterion
